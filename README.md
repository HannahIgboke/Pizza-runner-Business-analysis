## Introduction

Danny was browsing Instagram when he saw an ad for 80s retro styling and pizza. He loved the idea, but he knew he needed to do more than just sell pizza to get seed funding for his new business. So, he decided to Uberize it and create Pizza Runner, a pizza delivery service.
Danny started by recruiting runners to deliver pizza from his house, which served as Pizza Runner Headquarters. He also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to create a mobile app for customers to place orders.

## Data wrangling

### Data collection and database creation
Danny has a few years of experience as a data scientist and is therefore aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business’ growth. He has provided a subset of his data for the purpose of this analysis. I used MySQL Workbench to create a database for Pizza runner and for the entire analysis. Below is the Entity Relationship Digram (ERD) for the tables provided

### Exploratory data analysis

I carried out an EDA to investigate the data, identify loopholes and understand the relationship between tables. On inspection, I observed some inconsistencies in data types, formatting and the preence of null values which needed to be accounted for. After my EDA I proceeded to cleaning my data.
