## Introduction

Danny was browsing Instagram when he saw an ad for 80s retro styling and pizza. He loved the idea, but he knew he needed to do more than just sell pizza to get seed funding for his new business. So, he decided to Uberize it and create Pizza Runner, a pizza delivery service.
Danny started by recruiting runners to deliver pizza from his house, which served as Pizza Runner Headquarters. He also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to create a mobile app for customers to place orders.
